# clojure-programming-wilson

If you came to wonder while reading Clojure Programming, how exactly the book's version of the Wilson's Maze was different from the original algorithm. Well, here is my test leiningen project that happends to include that.

## Usage

lein run USEWILSON

         USEWILSON = true  (Wilson's algorithm)
                     false (Clojure Programming variant)
